# NixVim config

**PERSONAL** configuration for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) using [Nixvim](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/). Heavily inspired by [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> This project uses the [flake system](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) and is not intended to be used without Flakes.

The [flake](./flake.nix) exports two packages:

- `default`: Nixvim package built from the configuration files
- `lite`: Same as above, without the LSP stuff

## üì• Installation

```nix
{
  inputs.nixvim-config.url = "github:nicolas-goudry/nixvim-config";

  outputs = { nixvim-config, ... }: {
    overlays.additions = final: _prev: {
      nixvim = nixvim-config.packages.${_prev.system}.default;

      # Or use the lite version
      # nixvim = nixvim-config.packages.${_prev.system}.lite;
    }
  }
}
```

## üç± Structure

The config is mainly split in two directories:

- [plugins](./plugins): Nixvim plugins configuration, using a custom load mechanism
- [config](./config): nvim configuration (like options, global keymaps, etc)

Other configuration attributes may be found in [`default.nix`](./default.nix) if they don‚Äôt justify being in a separate file.

### ü•£ Configuration

The configuration is split in multiple files organized by ‚Äútopic‚Äù in the [config](./config) directory. These are auto-`import`ed in the main [`default.nix`](./default.nix) file.

### ü•¢ Plugins

The plugins are not explicitly declared as Nixvim `plugins.<plugin>` attributes. Instead, they are looked up in and loaded from the [plugins](./plugins) directory.

In short, a lambda will read the files in the directory and use the filename to assign a plugin to the right attribute. Example: `telescope.nix` will be loaded in `config.plugins.telescope`. Custom plugins are also supported, read further.

Each plugin file must export a lambda, which is called with an attribute set containing the `nixpkgs`'s library as `lib`. Plugins may or may not use it. It must return an attribute set which can contain the following attributes:

- `opts`: plugin options as expected by Nixvim
- `rootOpts`: extra options for the root Nixvim `config` attribute
  - this allows to further configure the plugin if it doesn‚Äôt expose a given option
- `extra`: custom plugin not supported by Nixvim
  - `extra.packages`: list of packages to be added as `extraPlugins` (ie. `vimPlugins.<plugin>`)
  - `extra.config`: plugin configuration in lua
